Scripts I wrote for teaching purposes for the experimental evolution (EE) course organized by the Institute of Population genetics in Vienna (https://www.popgen-vienna.at/training/other-courses/experimental-evolution-2019/).

  W-F_simulations.py: Python script that simulates the evolutionary trajectory of a locus (for diploids). It allows the application of a user defined selection coefficient.

  estimate_drift.py: Python scripts that estimates and plots the expected allele count distribution under random genetic drift. It applies two different approaches: a hidden markov model and a diffusion model.

  trajectories.py: Python script that estimates allele frequencies from sync files and returns the average across replicates.
